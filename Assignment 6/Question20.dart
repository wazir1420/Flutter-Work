//Q.20: Create a map named "car" with the following key-value pairs: "brand" as "Toyota", "color" as "Red", "isSedan" as true.
//Write Dart code to check if the car is a sedan and red in color. Print "Match" if both conditions are true, otherwise print
//"No match".
void main() {
  Map car = {'brand': 'Toyota', 'color': 'red', 'isSedan': true};
  if (car['color'] == 'red' && car['isSedan'] == true) {
    print("Match");
  } else {
    print("No Match");
  }

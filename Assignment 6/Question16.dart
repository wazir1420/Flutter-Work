//Q.16:Â Implement a Dart code that uses the where() method to filter out odd
//numbers from a list of integers. The program should take in the original list as a
//parameter and print a new list containing only the even numbers.
void main() {
  List orig = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18];
  print('The list before filtering and removing odd elements are: $orig');
  orig.retainWhere((element) => element % 2 == 0);
  print('The list after filtering and removing odd elements are: $orig');
}
